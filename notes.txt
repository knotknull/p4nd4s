Couple of different ways you can create a dataframe

# via a dictionary, key is column name, values are the row values
df = pd.DataFrame({'Yes': [50, 21], 'No': [131, 2]})
print(df)  
#    Yes   No
# 0   50  131
# 1   21    2
    
Another way is to create the data and columns separately 
df = pd.DataFrame([[50, 21],[131,2]], columns=['Yes','No'])
print(df)  
#     Yes  No
# 0   50  21
# 1  131   2   

Third ways is to hav ethe dictionary and name the index (this is the col 0 values i.e. row labels )
    # FYI: row labeels are an index and can be assigned 
    sdf = pd.DataFrame({'Bob': ['I liked it', 'It was awful'], 
                        'Sue': ['Pretty good', 'Bland']},
                       index=['Product A', 'Product B'])


                    Bob          Sue
Product A    I liked it  Pretty good
Product B  It was awful        Bland



# Reading files and getting a shape of data

wine_reviews = pd.read_csv("../input/wine-reviews/winemag-data-130k-v2.csv")
wine_reviews.shape

# and writing 
## now let's save it as a csv
wine_revs.to_csv('./data/map__wine.csv') 
map_revs = pd.read_csv('./data/map__wine.csv') 
print('map shape: ', map_revs.shape)



can manipulate the index to be a different column 
reviews.set_index('title')


can use loc for query like lookups 
reviews.loc[reviews.country == 'Italy']

enhanced query
reviews.loc[reviews.country == 'Italy'] & (reviews.points >= 90)]
